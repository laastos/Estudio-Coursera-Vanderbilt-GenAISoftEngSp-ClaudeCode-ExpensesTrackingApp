- Data is not shared between different browsers/devices
- No server or database required
- **Automatic migration**: Existing data is automatically migrated to include currency fields
- **Backward compatibility**: Works seamlessly with expenses created before currency support

For production use, you could easily extend this to use a backend API by modifying the storage utility functions.
